        <h1>About Me: Jinsong Lin</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jinsong Lin, and I’m currently a freshman at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), 
            pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering with a plan to also earn a Master’s in Computer Science.
            I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in New York City, where I developed a passion for technology and coding. 
            I have foundational skills in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Linux, and SQL, and I enjoy learning more about cybersecurity. 
            In my free time, I love playing basketball just for fun, especially at the courts in Gordon Field House on campus, 
            which has been a highlight of my college experience so far.
        </p>
